      Jill is a Regional Director who travels 4-8 times each month for work. She has a specific region in which she travels, and she often visits the same cities and stays at the same hotel. 
      She is frustrated by the fact that no matter how frequently she takes similar trips, she spends hours of her day booking travel. 
      She expects her travel solutions to be as organized as she is.
